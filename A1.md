## First Application: BITE
Link to application: <>[Place link here]

Type of application: Food and Drink
<p>Bite is a novel community style cooking application. People post the photos of their favorite dishes and then other community members make them and provide thumbs up or down. With those ratings, other community members decide what’s good and what’s bad.
The app also lets consumers decide what to eat next and it has become a lot easier with this application. Eating out is not boring any more at the same places. 
This application brings the transparency between the consumers and the restaurants. In this app some new updates have been installed like a couple of exciting tickers for the users to stay update on the feeds.</p>

I chose this app because I always felt the need of having an application which can let me skip the hassle of reading long reviews and decide my next dish with just one swipe. I can also recommend others to try the flavorful food I liked and enjoy it. As I am a big foodie like many others, so this app is an essential use for all the food-lovers out there.

•	The app is revolutionary as it lets user discover based on distance and budget. 
•	In the edit profile section in the settings, a feature to add website links and Instagram account has been provided. 
•	The app provides improved performance. 
•	With the nice cameras that everyone has, it will provide user with an idea of how the food looks to real customers and not just pictures from menus and commercials where things are fabricated.

First Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status 
• Are users being made aware of what is going on? 
Yes, users know what is going on. For example, when we create a new task, an app will show a task creation screen.

Second Application: Selfissimo

Why this application was chosen:

The app is one of the new Google apps. The app takes pictures automatically takes photos while the user poses. The application uses AI when user is ready for the picture. The app shows different kinds of things app is doing with their AI. The app is fun to work with and see what Google is working on.
The app uses experimental research technology from Google to click photos automatically each time you pose, encouraging you to capture your best self. 
Type of application: Photo & Video
Technologies: Selfissimo! Relies on technologies under active research at Google, so the performance is device-dependable. App is good with power machine learning and algorithm.

Buy-In:
•	The app also takes the photos and put them in the collages for the user.
•	It detects user face, enhances facial features like eyes, nose without making it look artificial. 
•	The app makes user looks really good than the normal selfie.

Strengths: 
•	The app uses a blur also while capturing photos.
•	It perfectly times the shots and clicks the photos at the right time. 
•	The user can go back and review the previous shots. 
•	The app works well while clicking photos by skipping the background and focusing on face. 
•	It doesn’t take photos of the times while you are changing postures thereby less blurry photos. The app blurs the background even for cheaper devices. 
•	One can delete single images and determine the final series of shots.

Weakness: 
•	The app clicks photos too fast. 
•	Sometimes the app doesn’t recognize the movement thus doesn’t click the photo. 
•	Also, at times photos aren’t autosaved thus if the user looses the screen then all the shots are lost. 
•	It doesn’t capture the entire image which it shows on phone screen, but crops it while taking a photo. 
•	Photos are black and white. 
•	The app doesn’t work the same if there is more than one person in the photo. 
•	Face is not detected in direct sunlight.


Improvement suggestions:
•	There can be little tuning with the shutter speed and AI recognizing movement. 
•	There can be additional filters in the app. 
•	Auto save feature is needed. 
•	Apart of the monochrome (b/w) effects there should be an original capture mode.

First Heuristic Evaluation: Help and documentation
•	Is help information provided? 
No, I can’t find help information separately, because there was no need for help information. Everything was very clear and start button is shown as soon as open the app. For example, after clicking the photos an option automatically pops after you stop photos capture to save media or not. 
•	Can help information be easily searched and easily followed? 
No, I can’t find help information separately, because there was no need for help information. Everything was very clear and precise.

Second Heuristic Evaluation: User control and freedom 
•	Are there ways to allow users to easily leave the unexpected page/state? 
Yes, I observed this feature. For example, it gives an option to start clicking of the photos and user can start posing, the app automatically captures photos. Once you want the app to stop capturing, there is an option available to stop clicking and it brings you to the page where there is an option to save the photos captured or not. If the user wishes not to save them then the photos are not saved and it prompts with START option if user wants to capture again.
